# What is the "Cartoon Converter Platform"? 
This project is mainly divided into two parts, namely cartoon converter and image resource sharing platform. You can access our platform through cartoon converter.
## Cartoon Converter
Cartoon Converter is an image processing tool that runs locally. It can convert any style of pictures into cartoon style. We now provide four styles for you to choose from. If you want to know more about it, [**please click here**](https://github.com/MeditatorE/Cartoon-Converter-Platform/tree/main/pretrained_model).

## Picture Resource Sharing Platform
The picture resource sharing platform is another part of this project. 

This platform is used in conjunction with the converter. Its function is to provide a resource sharing platform for artists to download and upload pictures, and to provide creative inspiration and picture resources for art practitioners. 

Anyone can upload or download pictures from this platform. Of course, we also provide an interface on the converter to help users easily upload their converted cartoon-style pictures.
### How to visit the platform?

We have provided an interface for entering the platform on the converter and uploading pictures to the platform.
